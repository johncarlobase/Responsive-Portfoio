            <p>Almost 42 yr old father of an adorable 5 yr little girl. Born in the Philippines then moved
                to United states at 29 yrs old. I moved around a lot in the states from New York,
                Nebraska, Indiana, Chicago, then the last 4 years here in Austin (and this would be home). I have been
                an Occupational Therapist for close to 20 years.
                But if I wasn't doing that and if my parents where filthy rich I would have been be a musician. Doing what I love.
                I can play the guitar, piano, bass
                guitar, Ukulele, drums. I collect guitars and the last time I counted, I have 15 guitars (mostly
                acoustic) I appreciate all genres but the least would be death metal (you know, that screaming-gurgling
                singing)</p>

                <p> I also love to ride my bicycle (road, MTB) and am usually at Veloway at Circle C doing a 30 mile
                    saturday morning ride.
                    I play badminton (the fierce asian kind. yeah google that!), Bowling, Volleyball, Basketball, Swimming.
                </p>

                <p>And oh yeah! I lost 77 lbs in 8 months starting Jan 2019. </p>
